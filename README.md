# MozartValsGenerator
The Mozart vals generator, from the old game created by Mozart a long time ago, where two dices was throwned, and they decide what part of precomponed music should be played.
For each run, the music is put together by a random generator in a new way, so that it will be very rare that the same combination will be played.
